3. MVP

    - [x] Object Lighing
    - [x] Make each side of cubes different color
        - [x] Only color "outer" sides of rubik's cube
    - [ ] Make movement of cube sides
        - [ ] via code
        - [ ] UI keys
    - [x] Camera
        - [x] via code
        - [x] Movement via position of cursor
